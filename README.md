## ðŸ“Š Project Details

### 1. Fruit Classifier (CNN)

This project applies a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify fruit images as either fresh or rotten. The model leverages deep learning techniques, including convolutional and dense layers, to extract features and make predictions on image data.

- **Data Augmentation**: Applies transformations to images to improve model generalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy to assess the model's performance.

### 2. Music Recommender System

This project implements a recommender system to suggest music tracks to users using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. The system provides personalized music recommendations based on user preferences.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on user behavior similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on item attributes and user profiles.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes precision, recall, and ranking metrics.

### 3. Forest Fire Detection (SVC & Random Forest Models)

This project includes Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Random Forest models to detect forest fires based on environmental data. These machine learning models classify data into fire and non-fire classes to assist in fire detection and prevention.

- **Data Processing**: Prepares environmental data for model input.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates SVC and Random Forest models on classification performance.

### 4. Bitcoin Money Laundering Detection (Random Forest Model)

This project applies a Random Forest model to classify Bitcoin transactions as either licit or illicit. The model uses transaction features to calculate a risk score, helping detect potentially illicit activities.

- **Risk Score Calculation**: Generates risk scores to assess transaction legality.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
